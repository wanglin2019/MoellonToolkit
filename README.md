![The MoellonToolkit framework](Docs/Logo/MoellonToolkit_logo128.jpg) MoellonToolkit is a library providing a set of convenient ready to use dialog boxes like: Error, Warning, Question, Information, InputText, Select Text,... MoellonToolkit contains also three components: a TabControl with closable TabItem Headers, a dynamic dataGrid and then a ObservableCollection extension. 

All of these dialog boxes and component can be used independently or grouped in a small framework designed for building WPF applications with the focus on the MVVM pattern.
It will enable developers to build solutions very easily. 

MoellonToolkit is developped with C# 4.0 so it can be used with .NET 4.0 and more.
